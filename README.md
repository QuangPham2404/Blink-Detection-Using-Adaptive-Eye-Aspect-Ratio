**About the project**
This is a collection of Eye Aspect Ratio-based blink detection algorithms. It consists of 6 non-machine learning alogorithms and 3 Support Vector Machine (SVM) Models. Codes for creating an evaluation dataset called "RealWorldBlink" and to conduct the evaluation process is also included. This project is developed 100% with Python.

**Important**
1) This project is still under development. Currently, the codes are still messy without proper comments, pseudo codes, and structure. This will be addressed in the near future.
2) This project is developed entirely in Python. The reason GitHub shows 68.2% HTML and 16.3% TeX is because the project includes many .txt files used to train the SVM models and store other data.
