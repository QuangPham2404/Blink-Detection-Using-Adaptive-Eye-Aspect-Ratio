**About the project**
This is a collection of Eye Aspect Ratio-based blink detection algorithms. It consists of 6 non-machine learning alogorithms and 3 Support Vector Machine (SVM) Models. This project is developed 100% with Python.

**Important**
This project is still under development. Currently, the codes are still messy without proper comments, pseudo codes, and structure. This will be addressed in the near future.
